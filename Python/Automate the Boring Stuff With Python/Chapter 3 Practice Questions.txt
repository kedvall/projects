1.	Functions are advantageous because the limit the scope of variables while allowing you to organize and compartmentalize your code.
2.	The code in a function executes when it is called
3.	The def statement followed by a function name and paranthesis creates a function. Ex: def testFunc():
4.	A function is the code that makes up the function. A function call is when that code is executed
5.	There is one global scope and as many local scope as functions that create local variables
6.	Local variable values are forgotten when a function exits
7.	A return value is the value returned by a function when it completes its execution. It evaluates to a single value and therefore can be used as part of an expression.
8.	That function returns the defualt value of None
9.	Global scope can be forced by typing global in front of the variable name you wish to modify
10.	It is the only value of NoneType data type
11.	The import areallyourpetsnamederic statement imports the module areallyourpetsnamederic and allows you to use functions in that module
12.	It could be called using spam.bacon()
13.	A program can be resilient against errors by using the try and except functions
14.	The try clause contains the code you want to try to execute that may contain a bug. The except clause contains the possible errors.
